# Product-Landing-Page-Project
This is a responsive HTML/CSS Landing Product Page Project 

I built a software product landing page that is HTML/CSS responsive, so make sure to try it on your cell to see the adjustments. This was really fun as I learned how to implement my own custom navbars using sticky headers, a decent footer, shadow boxes for flare, and even @keyframes animation to give the buttons an interactive feel. Nevertheless I really hope you enjoy this mock trial landing page!
